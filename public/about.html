<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Riya, a Computer Science Engineering student driven by curiosity and a love for technology. I specialize in Java, web development, and data structures, and I enjoy building smart solutions that make life easier and more efficient.</p>

<p>Recently, I completed a summer internship at C-DAC, where I deep-dived into Generative AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. <br>I've worked on exciting projects like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attendance System Using Face Recognition (Python)</li>
  <li>Network-Based Ping Tool</li>
  <li>Task Management System using PHP (with CRON jobs & email functionality)</li>
</ul>
<p>I love learning new technologies and combining logic with creativity in all my work.
<br>
Outside of coding, I've also managed social media professionally and enjoy collaborating with teams on innovative ideas.</p>
